The user is telling you the current state of their local project is good and should be synced to GitHub. You have full permission to stage, commit, and push without asking for confirmation.

Do the following:
(1) Run git status and git diff to see all changes.
(2) Stage all changed and new files (git add -A is fine here).
(3) Write a clear, concise commit message summarizing what changed.
(4) Commit.
(5) Push to origin.
(6) Report back: what was committed (files changed, insertions, deletions) and confirm the push succeeded.

You do NOT need to ask for permission at any step. The user invoking /git IS the permission.
