Prepare a co-author or future-session summary. Review:
(1) Git log since the last handoff (or last 7 days if no prior handoff).
(2) Any files modified recently.
(3) Current pipeline status (run /status internally).
Produce a plain-language summary covering: what changed, what outputs were regenerated, what to review, open questions.
Write to session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_handoff.md (create session_logs/ if needed).
