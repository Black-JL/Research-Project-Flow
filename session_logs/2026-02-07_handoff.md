# Handoff — 2026-02-07

## What happened

Today was project setup day. The Research Project Flow template went from initial scaffolding to a fully documented, GitHub-synced template repo.

### Commits (all today)

| Commit | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| `6bf5a68` | Initial project structure from template |
| `ad5b4b1` | Made Research Project Flow the public-facing README |
| `104efb6` | Simplified structure per authoritative references (G&S, TIER, AEA); added AEA style guide |
| `dfabfca` | Added Python support to the template |
| `8086dab` | Added `/git` command for one-step sync to GitHub |
| `3a40392` | Expanded command documentation in README with usage details |

### Key changes

- **Structure overhaul:** Consolidated from multiple scattered docs (pipeline.md, parameters.md, table_figure_map.md, PROJECT_README_TEMPLATE.md) into a single README.md. Removed 6 files, simplified to match Gentzkow & Shapiro / TIER / AEA conventions.
- **Commands:** Replaced early draft commands (audit.md, log.md, run-step.md, validate.md) with finalized set: `/status`, `/run`, `/check`, `/add-step`, `/handoff`, `/git`.
- **AEA style guide:** Added `manuscript/aea_style_guide.md` (818 lines) as formatting reference.
- **Global commands:** `/git` and `/handoff` copied to `~/.claude/commands/` for use in any project.
- **Git permissions:** Added global allow rules in `~/.claude/settings.json` so `/git` runs without permission prompts.
- **Python support:** `run_all.sh` now handles .py scripts alongside Stata and R.

## Pipeline status

Empty — this is a template with no data or scripts yet. No steps have been run.

## What to review

- README.md command documentation (lines 133–152) — verify the usage descriptions match your expectations.
- `~/.claude/settings.json` — global git permissions are now set. Confirm you're comfortable with that scope.

## Open questions

- None. Template is ready for use in a new project.
